swic
====
StopWatch Including Clock (and a timer)



Usage
-----
By default, swic acts as a stopwatch. It can be activated by simply typing `swic`. The stopwatch can be killed by the kill signal (default in most systems is ^C). 
	
The available parameters are listed here:

```
-h                 Display help
-t [[[[[YEARS:]WEEKS:]DAYS:]HOURS:]MINUTES:]<SECONDS>
                   Specify the duration for the timer. Exits on completion.
-c <loop>          Display the current time, optionally in a loop. Loop can be anything. As of this version,
                   it CAN NOT be used to continously display the stopwatch or timer values.
```
